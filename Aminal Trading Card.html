                <p>Dogs are mammals of the order Carnivora, specifically belonging to the Canidae family. There are hundreds of different breeds of dogs, each with their own unique characteristics and traits. A group of dogs is often referred to as a pack, particularly in the context of wild or feral dogs. Dogs are renowned for their keen sense of smell, which is far superior to that of humans, and their loyalty to their human companions.</p>
